At this point, I&rsquo;m not really sure <em>what</em> I think about it. To explain what that means, let&rsquo;s go back in time.</p><p>The year is 2020. We&rsquo;re in July. Lockdown has crushed education in two. It&rsquo;s problematic, but nothing we can&rsquo;t overcome. Surely?</p><p>School ended early, and, as a result, most people got their applications (for College) in early. We did the interview: &ldquo;I believe I am well-equipped for&mldr;"; <em>yada yada yada.</em> That wasn&rsquo;t fun. At this point, I was missing the social aspect of education: <em>&ldquo;Where are all my friends?"</em></p><p>Anyway, fast forward a few months, and we&rsquo;re in full swing: I signed up for Computer Science, so some of the work is about technology. But in all honesty, the majority of it ranges from <em>life education</em> (whatever that means) to creating a website with Wix.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve been programming for over 6 years, now. I know how the web works. I understand how to style with CSS, write semantic HTML, and use JavaScript&mldr; so why the <em>hell</em> are we using Wix? Who designs these courses?</p><p>This is turning into a rant, but the central point is that, throughout my life, I&rsquo;ve never really had anything to cater to my skills. Back in &ldquo;high school&rdquo;, the IT class mostly focused on Excel. That didn&rsquo;t interest me at all. I wanted more from the computer. I didn&rsquo;t want to be tied to a proprietary suite of office tools geared towards the consumer. <em>&ldquo;Not my style."</em></p><p>So, with that in mind, I was hoping College would be different. &ldquo;Finally something to tap into my skills,&rdquo; was the initial assumption. But that hasn&rsquo;t turned out to be true. If you take a look at the syllabus here, a lot of it has no relevance to computers at all. The tutors are helpful, but not really teaching what I want to learn.</p><p>Now, I&rsquo;m betting other people are in the same boat too. It&rsquo;s somewhat oppressive. You feel out of place. With nothing to encourage you to learn what <strong>YOU</strong> want to learn, you feel out of place. It starts to feel like a &lsquo;hobby&rsquo; rather than something you&rsquo;d like to get paid for in future. The education system is failing you.</p><p><strong>This needs to change.</strong> For 6 years, I&rsquo;ve been waiting for an actual education. I don&rsquo;t want to learn what <em>they</em> want me to learn. It&rsquo;s time for me to do my own thing.</p><p><strong>Does this mean dropping out?</strong> Hopefully not, but time will tell. A lot of successful people are dropouts, so it wouldn&rsquo;t be the end of the world.</p><p>I&rsquo;ll update this blog as time goes on.</p><blockquote><p>Written with <a href=https://stackedit.io/>StackEdit</a>.</p></blockquote><blockquote></blockquote></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h>Read other posts</span><hr></div><div class=pagination__buttons><span class="button next"><a href=/posts/firefox-and-the-fanboys.md/><span class=button__text>Firefox and the Fanboys</span>
