So, as you may know, I've been in College for a few months now. At this point, I'm not really sure *what* I think about it. To explain what that means, let's go back in time.

The year is 2020. We're in July. Lockdown has crushed education in two. It's problematic, but nothing we can't overcome. Surely?

School ended early, and, as a result, most people got their applications (for College) in early. We did the interview: "I believe I am well-equipped for..."; *yada yada yada.* That wasn't fun. At this point, I was missing the social aspect of education: *"Where are all my friends?"*

Anyway, fast forward a few months, and we're in full swing.
