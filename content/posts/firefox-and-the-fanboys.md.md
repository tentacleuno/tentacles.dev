Firefox has many fans. Some of them recognise that Firefox [has](https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/jybx2w/uh_why_is_firefox_showing_me_sponsored_links_in/) [made](https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/6n52gd/addonsmozillaorg_and_aboutaddons_disable_google/dk7bqxw) [a](https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/14/mozilla-terminates-its-deal-with-yahoo-and-makes-google-the-default-in-firefox-again/) [*lot*](https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/bkgfk0/an_open_letter_of_frustration/) [of](https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/3i5dqq/an_open_letter_from_a_concerned_user/) [mistakes](https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/5qjzie/i_cannot_continue_working_on_my_addons_anymore_im/).

However, there are also a substantial amount of Firefox 'fanboys', who seek to defend the browser in any way, shape or means possible. This has created a culture of negativity and exclusion -- if you disagree with Firefox, these people will come after you.

This culture is sadly (and somewhat unexpectedly) inherent on Hacker News, a platform where developers congregate to talk about specific topics. This could range from privacy to development. 

Sometimes, [we talk about Firefox](https://reports.exodus-privacy.eu.org/en/reports/org.mozilla.firefox/latest/):

And people *really* don't like that.

Over time, more and more people are jumping to defend Firefox. People seem to assume that it's the pinnacle of open-source development, and it can do absolutely no wrong. I really hope we move past this elitist mindset. If the community continues to constantly agree with Firefox in spite of the facts, while also ranting about 'the way things used to be', Mozilla won't be listening any time soon.

Sorry.
